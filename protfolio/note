I spent my formative years at Kerala Samajam Model School, a place that holds a special corner in my heart. Mrs. Nandani Shukla was the guiding force as the principal, steering us towards success with her wisdom and leadership.

The memories of the old campus, where the school stood proud from 1980 to 2018, are etched vividly in my mind. The corridors echoed with laughter, the classrooms buzzed with curiosity, and the playgrounds echoed with the cheers of victories. But in 2018, after the summer break, we embarked on a new journey as the school shifted to a brand new campus, brimming with modernity and promise.

I joined this vibrant community in 2010, wide-eyed and eager to learn. My academic journey began with the science stream, where I delved into the mysteries of the universe and the wonders of biology. Those years were filled with awe-inspiring experiments, late-night study sessions, and friendships that stood the test of time.

As I reached standard 10, I faced a pivotal moment of choice. With careful consideration, I decided to switch gears and pursue commerce with computer application for my 10+2 education. It was a leap of faith, a decision fueled by my passion for both numbers and technology.

The years flew by, marked by challenges overcome and dreams chased. And in 2024, I proudly walked across the stage, diploma in hand, marking the completion of a chapter and the beginning of new adventures.

My schooling at Kerala Samajam Model School has shaped me in profound ways, not just academically but also personally. It's where I discovered my strengths, honed my skills, and forged lifelong bonds. And as I step into the world beyond, I carry with me the values instilled by this institution â€“ resilience, integrity, and a thirst for knowledge.
